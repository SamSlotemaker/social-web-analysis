As I've seen, the movie is inspired by his real life, and there are many interviews with Don Gabriele Amorth, as well as several books he wrote years ago about his ministry. As a Catholic Christian, I can say that I find Monsignor Father Amorth's direct testimony more important. For those who knew him, he was described as a cheerful and witty person, always ready to help others and with great humanity. The film certainly has other objectives, such as being visually striking and intriguing to attract a large number of people to the cinema and earn a lot of money. I sincerely hope that the figure of Father Amorth is faithfully portrayed, but it makes me reflect on the fact that even in the choice of the actor, someone who does not resemble him at all was selected (not to take anything away from Russell Crowe, whom I respect as an actor).",0

I have seen someone shapeshifted in front of me when I was in a college classroom. There was a Goth girl that use to sit next to me in class all the time. One day I said something to the professor and she started laughing and that is when her voice and face changed. No one else seemed to notice it. I was generally freaked out and froze in fear. When she saw that I saw what inhabited her body, She then got up and left the classroom. After that she never sat next to me again and started avoiding me. There were times she missed class for days. After that I remembered how odd she use to smell. It wasn't a body odor and she always looked clean and dressed nice in her Goth fashion, but she had an odd odor about her and sometimes it seems as if she had a shadow or an out of focus mist covering her body. Like she was out of focus. Every time she sat next to me I always had to grab my scarf or sweater because I started freezing for some reason. The day that thing popped out of her it all started to make sense to me. Weird stuff started happening in my home for weeks. I was generally freaked the hell out. Its almost like it was mad that it exposed itself to me. I had to blessed my home everyday until most of the weirdness stopped. It never completely went away until we sold that condo. There are unexplained and explained things out here people. The Church knows it and they have the tools to expel most demons and possessed people.",0
