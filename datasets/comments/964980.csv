I saw the movie today and it's been a while since I felt this good leaving a theater. I've been thinking about it all day and it's made me feel more uplifted. I also didn't expect such an amazing soundtrack, probably one of my favorites of all time. They even have Tangerine Dream who composed a lot of 80's soundtracks. The movie opens with a montage of 1984 including Ghostbusters and Beverly Hills Cop clips while 'Money For Nothing' by Dire Straits plays. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon work great together like always, and Ben wanted Chris Tucker to play Howard White who Chris happened to know. So Ben basically let Chris write his own role because they believe in working in a friendly environment where everyone cooperates, and it certainly shows in this movie. This movie's acting, directing, and soundtrack was so good I'm thinking of seeing it again this week.",0
