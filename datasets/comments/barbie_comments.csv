Not everyone is going to be exactly like you, so people are gonna like different things to you, and there's nothing wrong with that. Just like how I personally love gaming and some people don't.

(I cannot recall if I had the house or not, but I definitely remember the lack of stairs.) And according to others in the comments, another Dreamhouse had an elevator, but apparently it was aggravating to use. Also, when stairs were put in another version of the Dreamhouse, it was difficult to maneuver Barbie. So‚Äî Barbie simply floats from the top floor and plops into the car. The scene therefore mimics the way a child would move Barbie around, regardless of house design. Hope this helped!",1,ef5b78deaaf92d985f7f0105bf4405d59c8b1fee,8d12470b720849db5c615f2616f246420d5bf9fc

I hope not, but yk, sometimes things can really surprise us. This movie really doesn't seem like it's going to be feminist, it feels more like a movie that if u really want to and are trained to look at the empowerment of women, u will find it feminist, but it actually isn't. Idk, there's just smt telling me that Margot and Greta weren't completly lying when they said it's more of a Humanist film. If u think abt it, a movie that empowers everybody, will logiclly also empower women. But I think that bc ppl these days are so trained to appreciate the only female empowerment, we already reached a point were even those who worked on the movie themselfs, didn't actually think that much abt the empowerment of everyone included in the film, and only talked abt the empowermentof women. I'm kinda optimistic when it comes these things, I never judge badly a book by it's cover, in this case, just bc some ppl created some controversy abt this movie, I'm not gonna just assume the movie is feminist, like chill, I can't know for sure until I watch it, so until then, if there's still some hope for the movie to actually be good, even if it's only 0,01%, and I was interested in watching it, I'll watch it. I always do that w the movies I anticipate, not gonna lie, I get more oftenly dissapointed than surprised, but when I do get surprised, it makes me understand that it was worth to not give up on modern cinema... Bc modern cinema is usually dissapointing, but when it is Good, it totally reminds me of my love for movie-making, and it feels more refreshing than ever. Everytime I watch an actual good modern movie, I feel like I just completed 5 years of therapy in 1 or 2 hours. So I will watch Barbie, and hope the trash-rumours aren't true.
