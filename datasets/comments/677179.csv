He was the best part of Creed II for me. The relationship between Viktor and Ivan... for me that made Creed II as good as it was. Who knows? Maybe like Creed and Balboa...this time young Creed and young Drago can become like brothers in arms.,0

He wasn't Creed's enemy to begin with. That's what his dad implanted in him. He only fought creed to make his dad happy. It wasn't about being the best boxer or proving anything. All he wanted was his father's love and he got it towards the end when he had no fight in him left being that his own mom left him twice and the second time in his most vulnerable moment. I def can't wait to see them reunite and for Drago's son to help him remember what it was like fighting a bigger and stronger opponent. I'm excited for this release.,0
