In the classic anime, Mitsumasa Kido tells him to go to Greece and come back with the Pegasus cloth in order for him to find his sister. Looks like this movie might lead up to the battle at Sanctuary. If they do a good enough job, the second movie could be the Poseidon saga and the third movie could be the Hades saga. But that's being extremely hopeful that they get this first movie right. Edit: According to the most recent article I came across about this movie, it's supposed to be the 1st of 6 movies. But they'll be based on the Netflix adaptation of Saint Seiya. Soooo we'll have to wait until the movie comes out to see what direction they plan on going in. Also, Kurumada says he enjoyed the movie and thinks the fans worldwide will also enjoy it.",0
