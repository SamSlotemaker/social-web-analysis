The fact is that those guys can move in a manner that is atypical for their ages, and what they all have in common is martial arts training. Stop being internet smartasses.",0

That this world would intrigue people and make them interested in knowing more about it. It was so well written, so well directed. But most importantly, Keanu made this movie franchise what it is today Edit: For people saying the movies are not well written, just bang bang gun fu, allow me to remind you that John Wicks character is built up long before he ever touches a gun. The intricacies in the stories are in the details of the world. The rules of the hotel. Whatt motivates these individuals to break/ follow those rules? The writing Is much deeper than just mindless shooting.",0
