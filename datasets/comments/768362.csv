But what I really like is how it highlights a situation most don't think about. All your life, you're told to worry about your kids. Never take your eyes from them, keep a hand or one of those leash backpacks on them, etc. Which isn't bad, kids are easy targets being smaller and weaker. But this is highlighting how parents can be taken. I've never heard anyone say ""look out for your mom"" growing up unless she wasn't feeling well. But shouldn't we look out for them? Aren't children naturally responsive to a new man or woman their parents date? I was not a fan of my stepdad when my mom and him met because it's always just been mommy and me so why this new person in our life? Seriously though, it really is something I think everyone should be aware of.",0
