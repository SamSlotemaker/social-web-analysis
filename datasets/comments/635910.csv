One single chapter has enough things in it to make up its own horror story. This is one of the books I wouldn't even be against splitting into multiple parts. Jonathan Harker's stay at Dracula's castle, the voyage of the Demeter, Dracula turning Lucy into a vampire, the heroes chasing Dracula back to his castle, all of that can very well fill many movies.",0

The fact that he's already six-foot-seven helps to convey just how intimidating this version of Dracula is, and they probably made him appear even bigger. This made me actually pick Dracula back up and find the chapter where the Demeter appears, and it excites me to see how this film adapts even that small bit (which included a great deal of information nonetheless).

His main concern while on the ship is to weaken the crew & pick them off one by one. Exposing himself (in a bat form, no less) is very risky & out of character. He must have been desperate to end the retaliation in this version. In the novel, the last remaining crew, gravely wounded, tied himself to the helm holding a crucifix. He wasn't allowing Dracula to ever reach the shore and tries to keep him off land as long as possible (that failed). So I think safety isn't in the mind of the passengers but how they can keep this Evil from plaguing London.
