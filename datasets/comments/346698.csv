Not only does he do a TERRIFIC job capturing the himbo essence of Ken, but he also matches perfectly with Margot's vibe. And to anyone saying he looks ""too old"" to play Ken... every single actor playing someone in the Barbie World looks to be around the same age as he does. You can clearly tell these aren't teens or 20 year olds, so if they had gotten someone younger to play Ken, he would've been the one looking out of place. And either way, isn't everyone preaching about ""casting the most talented actor"" instead of someone else for a specific reason (in this case, age)? I don't know who else must've auditioned for Ken, and you can dislike the theme of the movies Ryan Gosling has acted in, but you can't tell me that isn't an amazing actor.",0
